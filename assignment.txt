In this react app I have implemented every case of useEffect hook.

In the app after the 3rd example. There is question related to useEffect
hook. 

Question- 
In the 3rd example, When the "+" & "-" buttons are click the values of count as well as Calculation are getting changed. 
But value of Calculation is not changing here.
Make the changes such the it set the value of changes Calculation here too.

Answer-
Steps to pass cypress test case:
The second argument to useEffect is an array of dependencies .
If you want to control when effect is to be executed after mounting the component, 
then pass an array of dependencies as the second argument. dependencies are values defined outside useEffect but are being used inside useEffect. 
React compares the current value of dependency and the value on previous render. If they are not the same, effect is invoked.
For this particular problem just pass the "Count" as the second second argument in the useEffect and cypress will pass the test case.
